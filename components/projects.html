  <h2>Development Side Quests</h2>
  <p>What good is designing something if you can’t build it? Here are some simple web apps I’ve made to learn, experiment, and explore.</p>

        <h3>Fair Share Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          This project helps couples with different incomes split expenses
          equitably. By entering both partners' after-tax salaries and shared
          expenses, the tool calculates a fair division—no guesswork needed.

      <img src="images/kaomoji-1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Kaomoji Click
      website, which features a clean, minimalistic design with a yellow
      background. The page displays a heading in Japanese characters (顔文字)
      with "Kao Moji" written below. Below the heading, there are four circular
      emoji buttons representing different emotions, followed by a grid of
      kaomoji (Japanese emoticons) that users can click to copy." />
      <div class="project-info">
        <h3>kaomoji.click</h3>
        <p>
          This project allows anyone to easily find, click, and copy kaomojis
          (Japanese emoticons) directly to their clipboard. I aimed to make the
          design as language-free as possible so it’s usable by the widest
          audience. (⁀ᗢ⁀)

        for the board game Lost Cities. The interface has a dark purple background
        with a grid displaying different colored card suits, numerical values, and
        a “Rotate” button. The design mimics the aesthetic of the game, using a
        skeuomorphic approach to match gameplay elements."

        <h3>Lost Cities Score Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          This one’s pretty niche! It’s a tool to calculate your score at the
          end of a game of Lost Cities. The design is unconventional but
          intentionally skeuomorphic, mimicking the way the game is played.
