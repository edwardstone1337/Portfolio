        Ed is an incredibly talented designer that I have had the pleasure of
        working with. He thinks laterally across creative and strategic
        direction, and brings unique initiatives to the team. He delivers work
        efficiently to a high standard, and is an effective listener and
        question asker. I would love to work with Ed again!
