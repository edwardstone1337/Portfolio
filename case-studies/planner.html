<h1>Inquisitive Planner</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Inquisitive Planner is a digital tool designed to help primary school
    teachers seamlessly organise their curriculum, plan lessons, and track
    student progress in an intuitive and structured way. Unlike traditional
    planning tools, the Planner integrates directly with curriculum-aligned
    content, enabling teachers to structure their academic year efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the biggest challenges teachers face is the need to balance
    structured curriculum requirements with the flexibility to adapt lesson
    plans to their students’ unique needs. The Inquisitive Planner was built to
    bridge this gap by providing a system that allows for structured planning
    while remaining adaptable to real-time teaching dynamics.

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Primary school teachers are responsible for planning engaging, educational
    experiences while also ensuring compliance with national and regional
    curriculum standards. However, many teachers still rely on disjointed tools
    such as spreadsheets, paper planners, and static documents, which are
    difficult to update and lack real-time collaboration features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the Inquisitive Planner was to create a user-friendly,
    intuitive, and efficient tool that enables teachers to structure their
    lesson planning while maintaining the flexibility to modify schedules based
    on student progress and classroom needs.

  <h2>Research and Discovery</h2>
  <div class="sub-section">
    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure the Planner was designed with real teacher workflows in mind, we
      conducted in-depth interviews with 15 primary school educators from
      various backgrounds. These conversations helped us identify pain points,
      understand existing workarounds, and define the core functionalities the
      Planner needed to have.
    </p>

  <div class="sub-section">
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Teachers need a way to quickly organise and adapt plans without starting
        from scratch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integration with existing content and curriculum standards is essential
        for seamless adoption.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaboration and sharing features would significantly enhance usability
        and efficiency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Progress tracking was a key concern, as teachers wanted a clear way to
        monitor completion across lessons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing a way to annotate lessons and units would enable teachers to
        keep personalised notes on their lesson plans.

  <h2>Design Process</h2>
  <div class="sub-section">
    <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      Based on our research findings, we began designing the first iteration of
      the Inquisitive Planner through low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. These
      wireframes outlined the basic navigation, the layout of the Planner’s
      different sections, and how teachers could interact with units, lessons,
      and curriculum structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      After internal feedback and refinement, we moved on to high-fidelity
      prototypes, adding interactions to test how teachers could intuitively
      navigate between terms, add units, and track progress.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div class="sub-section">
    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
    <p>
      To validate our design, we conducted usability testing with primary school
      teachers in real classroom scenarios. Teachers were asked to complete a
      set of tasks using the Planner, and we observed their interactions, noting
      areas where they encountered friction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Iterative testing led to improved navigation and more intuitive
        workflows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Teachers highlighted the importance of clear instructional cues and a
        seamless experience for modifying their plans.
      </li>
      <li>
        We introduced a progress tracking system based on feedback that allowed
        teachers to mark lessons as complete.
      </li>
    </ul>
